# reactive-basics
Demonstration project for basics in using reactive programming paradigm

**Using:**

Spring Reactive Web \
Lombok

**What to check:**

Inside `PersonRepositoryImplTest` you will see tests which show basic usage of implemented methods using _Mono_ and _Flux_.

**Notes:**

Did not use any database (or Spring Data) so I mimicked the implementation which would have been done automatically by Spring (`PersonRepositoryImpl`)
